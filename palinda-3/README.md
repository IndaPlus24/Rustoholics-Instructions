# Parallel Performance
For the final task, we investigate the performance gains we can achieve by enabling parallelism and building programs that encourage concurrency as much as possible.

### üíÄ Deadline
This work should be completed before the exercise on **Thursday 19th April**.

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see the
[assignments section of the course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-23/course-instructions#assignments).

### üìù Preparation
In Canvas there is a single activity called `Task Preparation` with a link to online material. You **must attempt all the questions** for the relevant task. You also must have accepted the section invitation via email to be able to access the material.

You can also review the lecture slides: 
- [Concurrency Patterns and Mutexes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/193b7qpcEW3WdqmFGlA-4j9HL0FN0FdTtjYLuMg7cG7g/edit#slide=id.p)
- [Group Synchronisation and Parallel Go](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15kkxEB998IV6hYOX_E-hacRMHelsNqtMgl45M8kSEOg/edit#slide=id.p)

And read the companion literature:
  - [Mutual exclusion](http://yourbasic.org/golang/mutex-explained/)
  - [Efficient parallel computation](http://yourbasic.org/golang/efficient-parallel-computation/)

Finally, if you have not pushed an task submission before using Git/Github, then watch our [handy guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp5AASmX4no&list=PLZtN6QLX2rBA_gL6zs-qijIDihx-p2tO8).

### ‚úÖ Learning Goals
* Understanding synchronisation in concurrent Go programs
* Modifying existing code to take advantage of concurrency and parallelism

### üö® Troubleshooting Guide
If you have any questions or problems, follow this procedure: <br/>

1. Look at this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-23/help/issues). Are other students asking about your problem?
2. If not, post a question yourself by creating a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-23/help/issues/new). Add a descriptive title, beginning with "Task *x*: *summary of problem here*"
3. Ask a TA in person during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA). Check your schedule to see when the next lab is.

We encourage you to discuss with your course friends, but **do not share answers**! Similarily, use of AI services  ü§ñ are great to *help explain things*, but please **do not submit AI-generated solutions** - you must be both responsible for your own solutions and be able to explain them under examination.

### üèõ Assignment

#### Task 1 - Matching Behaviour

Take a look at the program [matching.go](src/matching.go). Explain what happens and why it happens if you make the following changes. Try first to reason about it, and then test your hypothesis by changing and running the program.

  * What happens if you remove the `go-command` from the `Seek` call in the `main` function?
  * What happens if you switch the declaration `wg := new(sync.WaitGroup`) to `var wg sync.WaitGroup` and the parameter `wg *sync.WaitGroup` to `wg sync.WaitGroup`?
  * What happens if you remove the buffer on the channel match?
  * What happens if you remove the default-case from the case-statement in the `main` function?

Hint: Think about the order of the instructions and what happens with arrays of different lengths.

#### Task 2 - Fractal Images

The file [julia.go](src/julia.go) contains a program that creates Julia Set
fractal images and writes them to file. You can watch a quick explainer on the Julia Set
and its relationship to the Mandelbrot Set
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg4bp7G0D3s), to get an idea of the type
of images that are produced.

To start with read through the code to get an idea of how it works. Some things
to note:

* `var Funcs []ComplexFunc = []ComplexFunc{` on line 18 is an array of functions.
Note how Go lets us iterate through this array and pass each function as an
argument to the `CreatePng` function in the `Main` function (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function).

* In the `CreatePng` function it is the `Julia` function that creates the image and it does this by iterating through each pixel of the image to paint the final
image. The actual calculation whether to paint a pixel occurs in the `Iterate`
function in the _blink and you miss it_ line 73: `z = f(z)`, using the function from the `Funcs` array that has been passed through several functions.

The program works, but is pretty slow. In order to get a sense of how long the
program takes, you can time it using a stop watch, or more conveniently using
the `time` keyword in Bash:

```bash
$ time go run julia.go
go run julia.go  11.10s user 0.60s system 97% cpu 11.974 total
```

Your own system will have its own runtime, but in the example above we find that
it completed in 11.10s with the CPU running at 97% load.

Your assignment is to find different ways to divide the computations so that
they run in parallel on all available CPUs. Use the ideas from the example in
the [efficient parallel
computation](http://yourbasic.org/golang/efficient-parallel-computation/)
section of the course literature.

Please note that simply making everything concurrent with more and more Gorountines does not necessarily get you faster performance after a certain point (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), so think carefully how you split the problem up (hint: each individual pixel does not needs its own Goroutine).

> **Assistant's note:** In more recent versions of Golang (since 1.5), the runtime will default to use as many operating system threads as it is allowed. To see differences in behaviour, refer to the [GOMAXPROCS](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS) function and vary the value.

Make sure you add a comment in [julia.go](src/julia.go) with your **original
runtime** and your **improved runtime**.

#### Task 3 - MapReduce

In the final task, you will be applying the MapReduce model for improving a word frequency program.

> **Assistant's note:** We actually struggled to find a nice introductory explanation beyond our own example below, as the full model has several more layers that we are skipping. If you are curious, check out the original Google research article and see how you get on! https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub62

A word frequency analysis of a document will return a summary of the word counts for all unique words in the document. Whilst this can be solved efficiently using a map data structure in a sequential program, the performance can be improved by parallelising the program.

> **Assistant's note:** Typically we ignore case when counting the frequency so 'Hello', 'HELLO' and 'hello' are all counted as 'hello', so remember to convert all strings to lower case. We also ignore punctuation marks, so these must be removed as well.

By splitting the document into sub-documents and conducting a partial count in parallel (_Map_ task), we can arrive at the solution by combining all the partial results into a final result (_Reduce_ task).

Read the code in [singleworker/words.go](src/singleworker/words.go) and complete the missing parts:

- Implementation for the `WordCount` function
- Reading a text file into a string in the `main` function
- Filtering duplicate versions of words in different cases, removing punctuation marks, etc
- Check that the unittest passes
- Log the runtime performance in the table below

Once you are satisfied with the singleworker, move into [mapreduce/words.go](src/mapreduce/words.go) and parallelise the program in order to improve the performance.

> **Assistant's note:** Part of the challenge here is identifying the different tasks that can be made parallel. This can happen at multiple levels so pay attention for opportunities to increase the performance.

- Update the `WordCount` function with the Map and Reduce tasks, using goroutines to parallelise and a channel to gather partial results
- Check that the unittest passes
- Find the optimal amount of gorountines before you encounter diminishing returns in performance improvements
- Log the runtime performance in the table below


|Variant       | Runtime (ms) |
| ------------ | ------------:|
| singleworker |          xxx |
| mapreduce    |          yyy |

And with that, you are on your way to Google-scale problems ;-)
