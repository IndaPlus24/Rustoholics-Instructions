# DD1337 Week 6

Modified: Dmitry Chirin

## The Internet is for... Fun!

This week we'll be working on implementing networking for the chess libraries.

To get started, see the Rust book's [multithreaded server example project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html). 

### Prepare your assignment

1. Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-6`
2. Start working on your prefered assignment.

Tobias Hansson has graciously provided some of my old Java code under `./java-examples` a server and client program. Even though we're going to be working in Rust, it's a simple and good example you can take some inspiration from.

Viola SÃ¶derlund has touched up a very simple Rust server and a client under `./rust-example`. Check it out!

## Assignment

### Improve your chess-gui!

If you want to you could add multiplayer functionality to your chess-guis (or someone elses).
