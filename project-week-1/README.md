# DD1349 | Week 1
## Continue Planning Your Project!
_Don't forget the palinda._

Sometimes projects don't turn out as expected. The least you can do is to lay out your expectations. Everyone should be reaching for the same goal with somewhat aligned prioritizations.

Since your project doesn't come with specific instructions or a clear picture of what result to produce, you have to reach an understanding within your groups of what to produce. 

**Fact**: Most conflicts are pseudo-conflicts; conflicts that shouldn't be; conflicts born out of a misunderstanding rather than differing opinions.

## Assignment
### Define your project
Yes! The task this week is only to continue preparing for the project by laying out your specifications.

1. Define milestones for your project.
2. Compile a board/table of _must-haves_, _nice-to-have_ and _risks_.
   - Separate your project MVP requirements from the "dream" scenario.
   - Admit the obvious risks and bottlenecks.
3. Entertain a fashionable README file.

See week 0 for project expectations.

## Structure

Though it's not required for you to differentiate these in your specifications; in project management it's important to differ between business requirements, system requirements and functional requirements. Business requirements define the value or desired _user experience_ of a product. System requirements define _what_ a product should do. Functional requirements define _how_ a product should do it. Each business requirement can imply multiple system requirements, which in turn can imply several functional requirements.

Coffee brewer example:
- B-Req: User should be able to drink freshly brewed coffee without burning their tongue.
- S-Req: The brewer must brew coffee at a temperature no more than 90 degrees.
- F-Req: The water cooking stage is exited when the temperature sensor reaches 90 degrees. 

A larger project measures its progress in stories/epics after each business requirement. An epic contains multiple milestones with sub-milestones representing each system requirement. Further, each milestone has several associating issues representing functional requirements.

Treat your short project description as your set of business requirements, your milestones as your system requirements and your issues as functional requirements. Even bug issues belongs to a milestone.
