# DD1338 Week 13

## Ray tracing

The ++-group used to have a ray tracing week during DD1337, before LINALG. This causes the work to be lacking in quality due to 'us' not knowing any of the underlying math. Building ray tracers are fun(!), but can be complicated!

By scheduling this over christmas, you're able to build everything from basic ray tracers to complex monsters of pure beauty.

### Prepare Assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-13` under the `IndaPlus24` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and start writing.
    - Implement a ray tracer.
    - That's it.

**Goldstar** for the Rustacean who still sticks to Rust. Rust is not mandatory in any way, I just like it.

See [the absolute chad of INDA++19 - Eskil's ray tracer](https://github.com/default-username-852/raytracer) written in Rust. (or the [even chader Benjamin's ray tracer from 2022](https://github.com/IndaPlus22/bwidman-raytracer) :sunglasses: (or the [chadest implementation](https://github.com/INDA22PlusPlus/dmitryc-raytracer/tree/readme) by Dima :) )

**Note**: You may implement your solution using any language (this includes Python *_host_ pseudokod *_host_ *_host_).

### Grading

Because your solution can be implemented using any language, write in a README file of how to build and run your application (that includes how to run your frontend application).

**NOTE**: We demand readable ray tracers, not compact ones!
