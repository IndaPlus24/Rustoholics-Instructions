# DD1337 Week 5

## Chess GUI Project

Great job creating your first ever chess-engine! Now that you are a certified backend-developer, it's time to find out how much you'll like (or dislike) being a front-end developer ;) This weeks task is to create a GUI for a chess-engine.

To write a front-end in Rust, you have two choices (with templates):
* The [Good Game Easily library (GGEZ)](https://ggez.rs/). For help, you're referred to the [library documentation](https://docs.rs/ggez/0.6.1/ggez/) and to the code repository's [very good examples](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/tree/master/examples).
* The modular [Piston](https://www.piston.rs/) library. [Examples](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/tree/master/examples). [Documentation](https://docs.rs/piston/0.53.1/piston/)

Some other alternatives:
* [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) - Uses component programming, very cool, but takes time to learn.
* [OpenGL](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/learn-opengl/), [Vulcan](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/) - If you really hate yourself and like agonizing pain, and want to do everything from scratch. But you learn tons.


You can of course use another library if you want to.

Take inspiration from existing chess games or go crazy and write something unorthodox!

### Requirements
**Must haves**
* You must be able to play a game of chess
* You must be able to restart the game
* The GUI must use someone else's engine

**Nice to haves**
* Put your own spin on it! Have fun! 

### Prepare assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-5` under the `IndaPlus24` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and initialise a Rust application crate (like you did the first week).

See the template crate for help with code setup.

#### Linux

For the most based of users, additional dependencies may have to be installed for GGEZ to interact properly with all hardware.

The following is known to solve most issues:
```
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config
```

Unfortunately, GGEZ and WSL has been proven to be especially tricky. For example, if you are experiencing `'Failed to build context.: AudioError("Could not initialize sound system using default output device (for some reason)")'`, it is mentally sane to disenable the audio.
```rust
ContextBuilder::new()./*...*/.modules(conf::ModuleConf::default().audio(false));
```

#### Chess GUI templates

Navigate in your command prompt/terminal to `./task-5/chess-gui-templates/<piston/ggez-template>`. Run the application to show a chess board with the game state shown in text. 

The `resources` directory contains image files for all chess pieces, as well as the application icon file. The chess piece image files are loaded into image structures; a gift from me to you. Switch out the image files if you prefer to render the pieces in a different style. 

To switch from the uncomplete `chess-template` engine repository as a dependency, to one of your comrades' state of the art creations, change the target URL in the `Cargo.toml` file.
```toml
chess_template = { git = "https://github.com/INDAPlus21/chess-template.git" }
```
